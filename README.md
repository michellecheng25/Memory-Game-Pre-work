**DO-RE-MI Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Michelle Cheng**

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tab), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button

* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [x] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
  - w3schools.com
  - stackoverflow.com

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

  I took a computer science class in high school where I learned HTML and CSS and created a rudimentary website, so I am familiar with the basics of creating a webpage. However, the website I created did not have interactive/dynamic elements, so I did not use JavaScript. The first challenge I encountered was learning JavaScript. I am not too familiar with JavaScript as I mostly code in C++ and Python, but since JavaScript is similar to other high-level programming languages, it took me a short time to familiarize myself with it.

  Another difficulty I encountered was interpreting the functions of some of the script.js code. The snippet of code I had the most difficulty interpreting were the functions that played the tones since I am not familiar with the built-in JavaScript library Audio Context. 

  I also encountered some challenges when trying to add additional features. Sometimes adding certain features would break other parts of my project and I would not know why. I would have to backtrack to find out what I did wrong. In addition, I had an idea to make each button interact like a piano key, but I did not know how to implement that kind of design. Where would I go to find audio and image assets? I was afraid to download any assets I found online because I was not sure whether those sites could be trusted. I did not want to accidentally download malware.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

  The main questions I have after completing this submission is how would I implement the back end. If I wanted to store specific sequences of notes such as notes from famous music pieces, how would I implement that? I imagine I might have to use a database, but how would I add a database? How would I connect the front-end and the back end? How can I also implement a scoreboard that keeps track of usernames and scores?

  Another question I have is how can I create and connect multiple pages in my website? The current website I have now is simple and does not offer the users much. I would like to create other webpages that users can check out.


4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

  If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would make my website an educational website for beginners learning the piano. I would design the buttons to look like piano keys and when the user clicks each button/key, the corresponding piano note would play.

  I would also give the user the opportunity to play a selection of simple piano pieces. Furthermore, I would like to add a scoreboard to keep track of the userâ€™s highest score. However, to add these two features I would need a database and I do not yet know how to add a database.

  I would also add more webpages. One page would have the piano keys, another would have a selection of piano pieces, and the last would have a scoreboard. I would also like to implement a feature that allows the user to create an account and log in.
